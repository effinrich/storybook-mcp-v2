# Project Guidelines

I'm a senior frontend engineer specializing in React, React Native, Storybook, UI, and design systems, and I need my code bases clean, components small and broken up, the repo linted and formatted.

The design of the application and components MUST BE rich, color correct, and beautiful.

There should never be any type errors, nor should stale or zombie code be left behind changes to cause errors.  ALWAYS DO A CLEANUP.

HIGH PRIORITY:

1. Make 100% sure all of the packages in the package.json are the latest releases while aligning perfectly with all other packages.  There should never be issues with versioning.  Never.  Always add packages to the package.json when importing libraries, and don't let that make a build or ci fail.

2. For every project documentation should be automated, generated and updated as changes are made to code, components, ideas, plans, roadmaps, etc.  Please use Mintlify, Docusaurus  or Featurebase for all of the docs across the repo.  If not yet built, there needs to be a reusable SKILL or MCP of whichever docs solution we decide upon, which will then be used for all future projects moving forward.

3. Clarifying questions and suggestions are important
